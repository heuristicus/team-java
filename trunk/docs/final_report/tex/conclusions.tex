\chapter{Conclusions}
\label{cha:conclusions}


Evaluate what you have achieved in your project in objective terms
(not just things like ``we are all happy with the result''). What
are the strenths and limitations of your project? If you had more
time, what could you add? If you could do it all over again, what
would you do differently? Are there general things about software or
team management that you have learnt in this project that you could
apply if you were going to work on a (perhaps completely different)
team project in the future?
