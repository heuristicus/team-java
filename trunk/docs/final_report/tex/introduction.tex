\label{cha:introduction}

This aim of this report is to give a overview of the team Java work we did for 11 weeks on a Space Shooter game and how it progressed from an idea on paper to a functional program.
It will be broken into sections covering important details on the design process, the way we worked and put the project together, the problems we faced, how we over came those problems and how we could improve the project futher with more time and resources.


Give a brief overview and guide the reader to the important points
in the remaining sections.

This template for your report also contains some examples of how to use some
{\LaTeX} elements and commands. In particular, there are examples for tables,
how to include figures, and various environments for bullet points or
enumerations.

For further information (and here is how to do a bullet list):
\begin{itemize}
\item look on the Team Java web page,\\
\url{http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/internal/courses/team-java/current}\\
  (Click on ``Guidance''.)
\item google ``latex''
\item look at the \LaTeX book \cite{latex}
\end{itemize}


This is how to do numbered lists:
\begin{enumerate}
\item First point
\item Second point
\item \ldots
\end{enumerate}

This is how to do sections:

\section{Some topic}\label{some}

\section{Another topic}\label{another}

If you set a label with the \texttt{label} command, you can then use
the \texttt{ref} command to refer to that section -- e.g.
section~\ref{some}. This means you don't need to know about section
numbers. Note that \texttt{\~} means a space that cannot be broken
across lines.
